# SonnyHuynh.github.io

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Overview
This website serves as my online portfolio, featuring my projects, resume, and contact information. It is built using static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and fast loading.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About me
- `projects.html` — Project portfolio
- `contact.html` — Contact information
- `css/style.css` — Main stylesheet
- `js/script.js` — JavaScript for interactivity
- `images/` — Images and documents (e.g., resume, project images)

## Usage

To view the website locally, open `index.html` in your browser. To deploy updates, push changes to the `main` branch; GitHub Pages will automatically update the live site.

## License

This project is for personal use. Feel free to use the structure as inspiration for your own site.
